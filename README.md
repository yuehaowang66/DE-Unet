# DE-Unet
This is a refernce code in “DE-UNet: An enhanced UNet with Dual-Branch Attention and Mul-ti-Scale Aggregation for UAV Lane Line Segmentation”. Our code is based on UNet.


The code has been open-sourced. It is worth noting that in the open-source code model, we default to a linear interpolation upsampling method, but in actual execution, the transposed convolution is employed.
